# **Understanding fundamentals of gitbash and github**
Before jumping down into the key learnings of this task, let us understand the basic terminologies we need to know about this topic.  
What is Git?  
Well, git is a version control system which tracks the changes made on a code. 
*Personalized tracker of your code!!*
What is  GitHub?  
GitHub is a library of your code. A library which stores all the details of your work as well as a  platform that allows developers to  share, and collaborate on code.
Then, what is Git Bash?  
Git Bash is a command-line tool that allows you to use Git, a version control system, on Windows. It provides an environment similar to Linux, making it easier to run Git commands and other Unix-style commands that aren't natively available in Windows.
## Task work:
In this task, firstly I created a repository in my local device using git command lines, which are *cd* (change directory) and *mkdir* (make a directory) and *init*(to initialise an empty git repository). Later, I wrote a code to display piece of information, a change which wasn't updated. Once the changes were done, I used *git add*, *git commit* (with a message) and *git push* to update my changes in the remote as well. Later, I accepted the pull request and ensured that all the changes were updated remote as well. Here are few glimpses:

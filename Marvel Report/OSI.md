# OSI MODEL
OSI stands for Open System Intercommunication. In detail explaination:  

WHAT IS OSI MODEL?  
The OSI model was created to standardize and simplify how devices communicate in a network. It provides a common framework for understanding and designing communication systems, ensuring that different technologies and products from various vendors can work together.  
There are 7 layers of OSI model,whcih are:  
- Application layer
- Presentation layer
- Session layer
- Transport layer
- Network layer
- Data Link layer
- Physical layer  
    
Functions of each layer:  
1. ***Application layer***: The top layer where end-user applications interact with the network. It provides network services directly to users and allows applications to communicate over the network.
2. ***Presentation layer***: This layer translates data between the application layer and the network. It handles data formatting, compression, and encryption, ensuring the application can understand the transmitted data.
3. ***Session layer***: This layer manages sessions or connections between applications. It establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions.
4. ***Transport layer***: This layer ensures reliable data transmission between devices. It breaks data into segments, manages flow control, and can provide error recovery.
5. ***Network layer***: The network layer is responsible for determining the best path for data to travel across multiple networks. It manages logical addressing through IP addresses and handles routing between different networks.
6. ***Data Link layer***: This layer ensures that data transferred over the physical layer is error-free. It manages how data is packaged into frames and provides addressing through MAC (Media Access Control) addresses
7. ***Physical Layer***:  This layer is all about the physical connection between devices. It defines the hardware elements involved in the data transmission, such as cables, switches, and network interface cards (NICs).
